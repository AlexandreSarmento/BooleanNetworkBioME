# Boolean Network Analysis

This project includes: 

* A [Workflow with PyBoolNet/Python package](workflow_pyboolnet/pipeline_HIFaxis.ipynb)

* A [Workflow with BoolNet/R package](workflow_boolnet/BoolNet.md)

* A [Workflow with FBNNet/R package](workflow_fbnnet/FBNNet.Rmd)

* A [Workflow on Discretization](workflow_discretization/discretization.md) and Statistical Analysis with BiTrinA/R package

* A Workflow on Differential Expression Analysis: a time-series gene expression analysis of cell cultures in hypoxia.

  * [E-GEOD-18494](workflow_differential_expression/pipeline_EGEOD18494.md) presents microarray data from HepG2 hepatoma, U87 glioma, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells cultured in normoxia or at 4, 8 and 12 hours of hypoxia treatment.

  * [GSE142867](workflow_differential_expression/pipeline_GSE142867.md) presents RNA-sequencing data on erythropoietic cells cultured in normoxia or hypoxia at days 3, 7, and 10.
